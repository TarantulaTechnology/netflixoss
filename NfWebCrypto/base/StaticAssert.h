// This is a static assertion macro that should hold us over until we get real
// compiler-supported static assertions in C++0x.  This is similar to the Boost
// implementation.  It only has one caveat: the implementation depends on an
// enum that uses the current line number to prevent name collisions.  However,
// if one file includes another one that has a static assertion on the same
// line, then there will be a spurious compile error.  The solution to that
// problem is to move one of the static assertions down or up one line.  :)

// The 4.3 version of gcc supports C++0x static assertions natively, with the
// -std=c++0x option enabled.

#ifndef StaticAssert_h
#define StaticAssert_h

// The generic assertion template:
template <bool assert> struct STATIC_ASSERTION;

// Partial specialization for true assertions:
template <> struct STATIC_ASSERTION<true> {
  static int const value = 1;
};

// Partial specialization for false assertions is intentionally missing.

// This is done so the line number can become part of the enum name:
#define ASSERTION_ENUM_NAME2(x) ASSERTION_ENUM_ ## x
#define ASSERTION_ENUM_NAME(x) ASSERTION_ENUM_NAME2(x)

// The useful assertion macro.  This is the external interface:
#define STATIC_ASSERT(x) enum { \
  ASSERTION_ENUM_NAME(__LINE__) = STATIC_ASSERTION<x>::value \
}

#endif
