Things To Do
------------

In priority order,

1. Code review, especially security
2. C++ gtest smoke tests, to run with the build
3. Port unit tests from Jasmine to [W3C test framework](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) and contribute there
4. Refactor / tame the gigantic CadmiumCryptoImpl.cpp
5. Implement algorithm normalizing rules
6. Keep pace with the latest editor's draft (specifically, Promises, algorithm, and keywrap changes)
7. Add more algorithms
8. Fix the error code mess
9. Support Chrome on other platforms (macOS, Win)
10. Port to other plugin technologies, e.g. NPAPI for Mozilla, Opera, Safari
