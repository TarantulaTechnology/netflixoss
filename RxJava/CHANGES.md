### Version 0.12.0 ([Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.netflix.rxjava%22%20AND%20v%3A%220.12.0%22)) ###

This version adds to the static typing changes in 0.11 and adds covariant/contravariant typing via super/extends generics.

Additional cleanup was done, particularly related to `BlockingObservable`. Also the `window` operator was added.

The largest breaking change is that `Observable.create` now accepts an `OnSubscribeFunc` rather than a `Func1`.

This means that instead of this:

```java
public static <T> Observable<T> create(Func1<? super Observer<? super T>, ? extends Subscription> func)
```

it is now:

```java
public static <T> Observable<T> create(OnSubscribeFunc<T> func)
```

This was done to simplify the usage of `Observable.create` which was already verbose but made far worse by the `? super` generics.

For example, instead of writing this:

```java
Observable.create(new Func1<Observer<? super SomeType>, Subscription>() {
   /// body here
}
```

it is now written as:

```java
Observable.create(new OnSubscribeFunc<SomeType>() {
   /// body here
}
```

This is a major refactor of rxjava-core and the language adaptors. 

Note that there are *breaking changes* in this release. Details are below.

After this refactor it is expected that the API will settle down and allow us to stabilize towards a 1.0 release.

* [Pull 332](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/pull/332) Refactor Core to be Statically Typed

RxJava was written from the beginning to target the JVM, not any specific language.

As a side-effect of Java not having lambdas/clojures yet (and other considerations), Netflix used dynamic languages with it predominantly for the year of its existence prior to open sourcing.

To bridge the rxjava-core written in Java with the various languages a FunctionalLanguageAdaptor was registered at runtime for each language of interest.

To enable these language adaptors methods are overloaded with `Object` in the API since `Object` is the only super-type that works across all languages for their various implementations of lambdas and closures.

This downside of this has been that it breaks static typing for Java, Scala and other statically-typed languages. More can be read on this issue and discussion of the subject here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rxjava/bVZoKSsb1-o

This release:

- removes all `Object` overload methods from rxjava-core so it is statically typed
- removes dynamic FunctionalLanguageAdaptors 
- uses idiomatic approaches for each language adaptor 
  - Java core is statically typed and has no knowledge of other languages
  - Scala uses implicits
  - Groovy uses an ExtensionModule
  - Clojure adds a new macro ([NOTE: this requires code changes](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/tree/master/language-adaptors/rxjava-clojure#basic-usage))
  - JRuby has been temporarily disabled (discussing new implementation at https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/320)
- language supports continue to be additive
  - the rxjava-core will always be required and then whichever language modules are desired such as rxjava-scala, rxjava-clojure, rxjava-groovy are added to the classpath
- deletes deprecated methods
- deletes redundant static methods on `Observable` that cluttered the API and in some cases caused dynamic languages trouble choosing which method to invoke
- deletes redundant methods on `Scheduler` that gave dynamic languages a hard time choosing which method to invoke

The benefits of this are:

1) Everything is statically typed so compile-time checks for Java, Scala, etc work correctly
2) Method dispatch is now done via native Java bytecode using types rather than going via `Object` which then has to do a lookup in a map. Memoization helped with the performance but each method invocation still required looking in a map for the correct adaptor. With this approach the appropriate methods will be compiled into the `rx.Observable` class to correctly invoke the right adaptor without lookups. 
3) Interaction from each language should work as expected idiomatically for that language.

Further history on the various discussions and different attempts at solutions can be seen at https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/pull/304, https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/204 and https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/208

This release includes a breaking change as it changes `onError(Exception)` to `onError(Throwable)`. This decision was made via discussion at https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/296.

Any statically-typed `Observer` implementations with `onError(Exception)` will need to be updated to `onError(Throwable)` when moving to this version.

### Version 0.9.0 ([Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.netflix.rxjava%22%20AND%20v%3A%220.9.0%22)) ###

This release includes breaking changes that move all blocking operators (such as `single`, `last`, `forEach`) to `BlockingObservable`.

This means `Observable` has only non-blocking operators on it. The blocking operators can now be accessed via `.toBlockingObservable()` or `BlockingObservable.from(observable)`.

Notes and link to the discussion of this change can be found at https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/pull/272.

This is a breaking (non-backwards compatible) release that updates the Scheduler implementation released in 0.7.0.

See https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/19 for background, discussion and status of Schedulers.

It is believed that the public signatures of Scheduler and related objects is now stabilized but ongoing feedback and review by the community could still result in changes.

This release adds the foundations of Rx Schedulers.

There are still open questions, portions not implemented and assuredly bugs and behavior we didn't understand and thus implemented wrong.

Please provide bug reports, pull requests or feedback to help us on the road to version 1.0 and get schedulers implemented correctly.

See https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/19#issuecomment-15979582 for some known open questions that we could use help answering.

*NOTE:* This is a version bump from 0.5 to 0.6 because [Issue 173](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/173) and [Pull 184](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/pull/184) include breaking changes.

These changes are being done in the goal of matching the [Rx.Net](https://rx.codeplex.com) implementation so breaking changes will be made prior to 1.0 on 0.x releases if necessary.

It was found that the `last()` operator was implemented [incorrectly](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/57) (non-blocking instead of blocking) so any use of `last()` on version 0.5.x should be changed to use `takeLast(1)`. Since the return type needed to change this could not be done via a deprecation.

Also [removed](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/173) were the `Observable.createSubscription`/`Observable.noOpSubscription` methods which are now on the rx.subscriptions.Subscriptions utility class as `Subscriptions.create`/`Subscriptions.empty`. These methods could have been deprecated rather than removed but since another breaking change was being done they were just cleanly changed as part of the pre-1.0 process.
