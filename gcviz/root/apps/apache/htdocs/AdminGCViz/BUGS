This is more of a todo list than things that are deeply wrong, but I want to make the fringes that I know about public.

* all of the BUGs and Potential BUGs in all of the sources
* visualize-cluster does not work
* compute throughput, allocation rate from gc data (do this with PrintGCStats?)
* sar data (cpu, etc) needs to be visualized



* netflix internal: need to visualize facet data
* netflix internal: need to ensure that clients output vms cache refresh event overall and facet-level timing
    * gps
    * api
    * merchweb
    * ecweb (curently no facet-level timing for demand-fill)
    * accountweb (curently no facet-level timing for demand-fill)
    * ...
* netflix-internal: delta fail needs to be added to catalina parsing (right now all lines are plotted as begin/end overall)
* netflix-internal, maybe outside too: truncated gc logs (when ec2rotate logs purges stuff older than 7 days creates "unknown" gc events.
* netflix-internal: have if -z checks for status-properties-1, -2. delete empty files. don't do both if we get the output for one. Consider getting URL from discovery/entrypoints.
* netflix-internal: the squirreled away vms-gc-reports location is <appname>/<date>/<data> and doesn't have instance id in the path... This could be a problem for visualize-cluster.
* netflix-internal: Consider grabbing some number of recent ttime and threaddump files from /apps/tomcat/logs/cores
