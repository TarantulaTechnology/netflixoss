* This program is split into thee conceptual parts:
  * a top-level "driver" (visualize-instance.sh and visualize-cluster.py)
  * a remote data collection component (remote-data-collection/collect_remote_data.sh)
  * a visualization component (visualize-gc.py)

It's difficult to get a cross-platform visualization component, so I
opted for python's matplotlib, which is cross platform and has a
single-click installer available for windows, macintosh and linux.

* To visialize the data you'lll need python's matplotlib. One
  simple-to-install (and free) distribution that contains this is EPD:
    http://www.enthought.com/repo/free/
  This will (attempt) to patch your .profile equivalent to place itself first on your PATH.

* A note about how GC events are parsed. This software does not, at
  the time of this writing, use PrintGCFixup. Instead it uses the
  -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps datetime stamps (if available, secs since vm
  boot if not) as an anchor, and treats each of those things as an
  event.

GC events of this form:

are represented as a Full GC requiring 106 seconds rather than the
CMS-preclean part of ~52 seconds. I'm not sure if ~106 or 106-52 is
the stop-the-world part, but at that long of a pause, I'm not entirely
convinced that it matters. Bill Jackson votes that 106-52 is the stop
the world part. He's probably right. I'm surprised that the preclean
wasn't aborted.
